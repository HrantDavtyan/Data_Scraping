    "The last notebook (scrapy 2) provided Scrapy code for scraping a page from quotes.toscrape.com. Yet, there are several other pages on this website that one may need to scrape. Which means, we have to actually create a Spider that do the same scraping tasks for all the URLs, not just one. That can be implemented in several ways, but first of all, let's start a new project and generate a new spider.\n",

    "To start a new project, open the command prompt (move to the Data_Scraping folder, if you always do so) and run the following command:\n",

    "This approach is easy and user firendly, yet it requires you to know the overall number of pages (10, in our case). A smarter solution would be the one that will not requore you to have this information. If you take an attentive look you will notice that there is a **Next** button on each single page and there is only one page which is missing the **Next** button: the last page. The button includes a hyperlink to each next page. As there is not next page for the last one, there is no next button on it.
