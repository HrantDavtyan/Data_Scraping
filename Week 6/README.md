## Description
This folder includes materials covered during the 6th week of the course (2 lectures of 2.5 hour duration). **Scrapy** scraping and crawling framework was introduced following the official documentation. Sublime text editor and command prompt (directly) were used for executing the code (also Jupyter notebooks were used for Part 1). Topics covered include scraping quotes, putting timer, naming the agent, crawling over several pages. Packages covered include Scrapy.

**Resources**

- [Official scrapy tutorial 1](https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html) - the official tutorial from the Scrapy documentation that has also been followed during the lecture.
- [Official scrapy tutorial 2](http://scrapy2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html) - the official tutorial from the Scrapy documentation, which has not been covered during the lecture.

**Homework**

```
1) Use Scrapy to get the top Python questions from the first 3 pages of stackoverflow.com.
   The necessary data includes:
    - question,
    - URL.
2) Use Scrapy to get the top 250 IMDB movie data from this URL. The necessary data includes:

    - movie rank,
    - title,
    - url,
    - release year,
    - rating.
    - What is the average rating?

3) Get the the name of directors of the top 10 movies on IMDB.

Make sure to use both XPath and CSS approaches at least once in your homework. First 2 problems are worth
2 points each, while the third one is worth 1 mark. The overall homework is worth 5 points and 5% of final
grade. Anything additional is highly welcomed (e.g. calculating the mode of movie release years, calculating
the number of questions on scraping etc.).
