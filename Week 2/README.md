## Description
This folder includes materials covered during the 2nd week of the course (2 lectures of 2.5 hour duration). Python 2.7. programming language was introduced and Jupyter notebooks were used for executing the code. Topics covered include data types, control flow, functions, I/O. Packages covered include NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Pandas DataReader.

**Resources**
- Training - Python exercises and their solutions (though in Python 3) can be found [here](http://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/). Students are encouraged to check the topics they are not confident with.
- Datasets - AirPassengers dataset for time series analysis, Titanic dataset for machine learning training and Customer transaction dataset for R/F model building are available in a separate folder.

**Homework**
```
1) Construct a function, which will ask the user to input several numbers separated by commas and will calculate
   their average. (e.g. if the user inputs 3,5,7 the function must result in 5)

2) Upgrade the function above to also ask the user the number of occurrences to calculate the average for.
   (e.g. if the user inputs 1,3,5,7,9 and as the second argument to function inputs 2, the function must result
   in (7+9)/2 = 8. If the user inputs the same numbers as a first argument, but inputs 3 as the 2nd, then
   the function must result in (5+7+9)/3=7)

3) Construct a function, which will generate a random number between 1 and 100 (both included). If this number is
   between 50 and 100 (not included) the function returns "Win", if it is between 1 and 50 (both included)
   the function returns "Loss" and if it is exactly 100 then the function returns "Draw". (Hint: to generate a
   random number, one should first import a package called random (i.e. import random) and then use the function
   randint from there (e.g. random.randint(x,y), where x=1 and y=100 in our case)

4) Create a list of 3 stocks (choose whatever stocks you want, e.g. ["IBM","AAPL","MSFT"]). Create a for loop
   that will iterate over the list, get the data of relevant stock and print the first 7 rows of the data.

5) Upgrade the for loop above.  Now, instead of printing the data, the for loop should iterate over the list,
   get the data and plot it.

Each point above is worth one mark. The overall homework is worth 5 marks (and 5% of final grade).
You are encouraged to look through classroom materials, discuss with other students, yet your submission should
solely be your own work.

Anything additional (plot coloring, customization etc.) is highly welcomed.
