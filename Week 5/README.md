## Description
This folder includes materials covered during the 5th week of the course (2 lectures of 2.5 hour duration). Overview of the first 4 week material was provided followed by a midterm exam (exam paper available in this folder). During the 2nd lecture alternative libraries for scraping were covered (urllib2 as an alternative to requests, and lxml as an alternative to BeautifulSoup). Sublime text editor and Jupyter notebooks were used for executing the code. Topics covered include working with XML documents, scraping the web using XPath, differences between lxml and BeautifulSoup. Packages covered include LXML and urllib2.

**Homework**

```
The most trending YouTube videos (https://www.youtube.com/feed/trending) must be scraped (it is allowed,
according to robots.txt). You must get the following data on each movie:

- URL,
- title,
- duration,
- username,
- views.

1) Get the data using requests and BeautifulSoup (2 points),
2) Get the data using urllib2 and lxml (2 points),
3) Save the data into a CSV and a JSON file (1 point).

Please, provide Jupyter notebooks (or .py files) separately for point 1 (BeautifulSoup) and 2 (lxml).
Make sure to receive data on all trending movies. Anything additional (e.g. saving data also as a XML file
or calculating the average number of views) is highly welcomed.
