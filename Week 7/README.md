## Description
This folder includes materials covered during the 7th week of the course (2 lectures of 2.5 hour duration). Types of APIs (authorized vs unaothrized, premium vs free) were introduced, several popular APIs were covered. Jupyter notebooks were used for executing the code. Topics covered include getting data from Reddit, YouTube, Google Maps, Twitter, Quandl as well as analyzing (descriptive - correlation and var-covar matrices, heatmaps and histograms, and predictive - ols and logit, ARIMA and VAR) the data received. Packages covered include numpy (where function only), pandas (stats related component), statsmodels, seaborn, googlemaps, twittersearch, quandl.

**Homework**

```
1) Use Quandl API to get and plot (on the same graph) the Terms of Trade for Armenia and Luxembourg from the 
   World Bank database.

2) Calculate the 2nd highest value for the above mentioned database, for Armenia.

3) Draw the Net exports graph for Armenia based on the Merchandise Exports and Import for Armenia from the 
   World Trade Organization database on Quandl.

4) Draw the correlation matrix between arbitrary 3 stocks using the End of day stock prices database on Quandl.

5) Create a list of 10 cities. Use google maps API to calculate (inside a for or while loop) the distance of each
   of those cities from New York (in km-s).

Anything additional (e.g. time series analysis, graph customization) is highly encouraged.
