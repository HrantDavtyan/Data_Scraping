    "```\n",
    "pip install twittersearch\n",
    "```\n",
    "The package provides the opportunity to eassily search all the tweets on given keyword(s). The user can even set the language of the tweet, as far as the latter is supported by the twitter API. To be able to make use of the package one needs to go to the developers page on Twitter, create an account, create a new app and create an access token. Then Consumer key/secret and Access token/secret should be copied to be used in the code.\n",
