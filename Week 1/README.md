## Description

This folder includes materials covered during the 1st week of the course (2 lectures of 2.5 hour duration).
During the first lecture the course objective, structure, content, tools and frame were covered.
During the 2nd lecture HTML/CSS were introduced and how to host them on GitHub as a webpage.

**The Homework was as follows:**
```
Develop and style your own website using HTML and CSS, which should at least include the following components:

- A heading (which should change color and font once hovered) and at least 3 paragraphs (with at least one 
  hyperlink inside the text, similar to "AUA" from the lecture files),
- An image (preferably your photo, but other related picture/image is also accepted) with  an alternative
  text and sized using height and width,
- An ordered or unordered list (of hobbies, skills, extra-curriculum activities or anything else related),
  which should be inside a <div> tag with class="my_list" argument (or similar),
- A table (not necessarily with visible borders, can be used to structure the overall content of the website),
- A button (next/submit or else related), which will navigate to another page created by you once clicked.

Each point above is worth one mark. The overall homework is worth 5 marks (and 5% of final grade). It should
solely be your own work typed from scratch. Although you are encouraged to look through the files created in 
class, copying a code from that files is strictly prohibited and will result in decrease of grade.

Anything additional (borders, color, input forms or else) is highly welcomed.
