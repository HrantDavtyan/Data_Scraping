    "There is a built ing function in Python which is used for opening files. The function is called **open()** and takes two arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the filename (required argument),\n",
    "- the opening mode (optional argument).\n",
    "\n",
    "Opening mode tells Python for what reason to open the file. The possible values for that argument are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"r\" - **Read mode** which is used when the file is only being read, this is the default value of the argument, if it is not explicitly declared,\n",
    "- \"w\" - **Write mode** which is used to edit and write new information to the file (any existing files with the same name will be erased when this mode is activated),\n",
    "- \"a\" - **Appending mode**, which is used to add new data to the end of the file; that is new information is automatically amended to the end,\n",
    "- \"r+\" - **Special read and write mode**, which is used to handle both actions when working with a file\n",
    "\n",
    "The **open()** function works closely with the **close()** function, which tells Python to close the opened file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's, for example, write the lyrics of John Lennong's \"Imagine\" song to a new text file. Then that file will be used for reading purposes."
